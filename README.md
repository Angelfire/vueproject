# vueproject

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build
```

## Axios
vue-resource is getting moved out the official vue organization, that's why I used [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

## Mocky
Just to test how to make calls (http requests). [mocky](http://www.mocky.io/)

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
